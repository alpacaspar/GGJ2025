  - A guy like me, doesn't do all that talkin', I'm a doer not a sayer! That being
    said... you standing there, expecting me to bring you release from your selfimposed
    chains... Yes, I've decided. I shall grant it; your peace, my mercy. Don't mention
    it. I will order from you a {00} and a small {01}. Now you're free to do as you
    please, go out there and fulfill your destiny, lucky as you are to have one...
    Not all of us have it easy like that, some of us are just cursed with true freedom,
    and the world is not kind to those that carve their own path.
