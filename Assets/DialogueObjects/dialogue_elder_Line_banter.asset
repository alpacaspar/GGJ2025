  - Oh Lettie, where would I be without you.
  - You know, it gets lonely out here without you.
  - I feel like I might've forgotten something...
  - Why shouldn't I buy some new ones?
  - Ah, I miss those days.
  - Oh, that's right!
  - I've never considered that in all my years.
  - Age gives you a certain perspective on such things.
  - I still remember those awful times, that is why I try to enjoy myself here.
  - Experience and patience will help you through any difficult moment. Both things
    I have plenty of.
  - Quite right you are.
