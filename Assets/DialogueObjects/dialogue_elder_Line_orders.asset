  - Oh, there you are, dearie! A pleasure to see you again. It's been such a long
    time since I've seen you! It always brings a smile to my face to see you go out
    of your way to talk with me again. I've really missed this, you know? It gets
    so lonely without a kind face to greet me every now and then haha. Anyways, don't
    let me hold you back from doing your job... Oh you're still here? So kind of
    you, really. If you want I could place an order while you're here, then your
    boss has nothing to yell at you over, hehehe. Let's take a look at the menu,
    hmmm, oh yes I see you have nice soups. I always love soups, even though my brothers
    never did. Soup reminded us of the war-time that flattened most of this city
    back in my younger days. Where my brothers see the war and sadness, I'm always
    reminded of the small comforts and how soup could make me forget all the horror
    for a few minutes. It really does depend on your character how you see the world,
    I'm glad I've had mine strong enough to keep me happy even when times got hard
    after the war. Oh, wait, silly me, I was ordering wasn't I? Let's look at the
    menu here... I could get the soups but now my hunger for a nice soup kind of
    waned, haha. Actually, this weather does favor more of a {00}, don't you think?
  - Oh, you remind me of Felicia you know that? Just as tender and spindly. She'd
    always acompany me when picking flowers, never seen a sweeter girl in my long
    long life, and I've been alive for a very long time as you might now. A kind
    fellow on my walk to this place told me I might officially be the oldest lady
    in town! Isn't that such an honor?
  - Orders? What in the devils are you asking me for? Don't you have a clue of how
    to do your own job!? Get out there and get me my {00}! I can't believe it's even
    taken you this long, that's why your lazy kind shouldn't even be allowed in these
    streets. While you're at it getting my food from the kitchen get out of here
    you pompous pimp! Always taking what others worked hard for, only to slack it
    all away!
  - Hahahaha heeeeey, look at little Johnny here! You're just like our late nephew
    Johnny but three times the height! What did they feed you to get you so tall?
    We'd like both one of those, haha! All kiddin' aside kid, I would love for johnny
    long here to bring me a {00}.
  - Oh hey Rupert, I had no clue you worked here! Can you get your old neighbour
    a {00}? For old time's sake. I'm sure the neighbourhood misses me there after
    the accident, hehe. Don't worry, the nurses are lovely where I'm from, even if
    it makes me sad that I'm not allowed to leave anymore.
