  - We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time itself is convoluted;
    with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations
    shift and obscure. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If
    only I could be so grossly incandescent!
  - Thou disgracest myne honor with thine presence!
  - For that is how events goeth.
  - Eruditional!
  - Effervescent!
  - Ser Cumference wouldst have loven this place.
  - Conflagration! Conflagration!
  - That's whenst I realised myne wench was truly a witch!
  - Frivulosities disinterest me.
  - Art thou in serious mind whenst thee speaketh in these terms?
  - I never hath made it past that damned black knight.
  - Dark souls are upon us...
  - Kingdom come shall be delivered too.
  - The King never did appreciate myne efforts.
  - Ah... My dearest Priscilla... Myne battle for thee starteth today.
  - Knighthood is not easily bestowed, you know?
  - May the Lord grant me strength.
  - O, may it not tasteth of poultice...
  - Mayhaps aught we to order from the special menue?
  - And prehaps myne journey aught finally shepherd me to the King's field.
  - O, how I pray for thee and thine curse, cousin knight Pavol...
  - I may have forgotten where I left those old scrolls.
