Oh Lettie, where would I be without you.
You know, it gets lonely out here without you.
I feel like I might've forgotten something...
Why shouldn't I buy some new ones?
Ah, I miss those days.
Oh, that's right!
I've never considered that in all my years.
Age gives you a certain perspective on such things.
I still remember those awful times, that is why I try to enjoy myself here.
Experience and patience will help you through any difficult moment. Both things I have plenty of.
Quite right you are.

Oh, there you are, dearie! A pleasure to see you again. It's been such a long time since I've seen you! It always brings a smile to my face to see you go out of your way to talk with me again. I've really missed this, you know? It gets so lonely without a kind face to greet me every now and then haha. Anyways, don't let me hold you back from doing your job... Oh you're still here? So kind of you, really. If you want I could place an order while you're here, then your boss has nothing to yell at you over, hehehe. Let's take a look at the menu, hmmm, oh yes I see you have nice soups. I always love soups, even though my brothers never did. Soup reminded us of the war-time that flattened most of this city back in my younger days. Where my brothers see the war and sadness, I'm always reminded of the small comforts and how soup could make me forget all the horror for a few minutes. It really does depend on your character how you see the world, I'm glad I've had mine strong enough to keep me happy even when times got hard after the war. Oh, wait, silly me, I was ordering wasn't I? Let's look at the menu here... I could get the soups but now my hunger for a nice soup kind of waned, haha. Actually, this weather does favor more of a {00}, don't you think?
Oh, you remind me of Felicia you know that? Just as tender and spindly. She'd always acompany me when picking flowers, never seen a sweeter girl in my long long life, and I've been alive for a very long time as you might now. A kind fellow on my walk to this place told me I might officially be the oldest lady in town! Isn't that such an honor?
Orders? What in the devils are you asking me for? Don't you have a clue of how to do your own job!? Get out there and get me my {00}! I can't believe it's even taken you this long, that's why your lazy kind shouldn't even be allowed in these streets. While you're at it getting my food from the kitchen get out of here you pompous pimp! Always taking what others worked hard for, only to slack it all away!
Hahahaha heeeeey, look at little Johnny here! You're just like our late nephew Johnny but three times the height! What did they feed you to get you so tall? We'd like both one of those, haha! All kiddin' aside kid, I would love for johnny long here to bring me a {00}.
Oh hey Rupert, I had no clue you worked here! Can you get your old neighbour a {00}? For old time's sake. I'm sure the neighbourhood misses me there after the accident, hehe. Don't worry, the nurses are lovely where I'm from, even if it makes me sad that I'm not allowed to leave anymore.

Well aren't you a humdrum little lad.
Oh don't you worry Lettie, our food will come soon.
I may have patience, but I don't have all the time.
