Oh Lettie, where would I be without you.
You know, it gets lonely out here without you.
I feel like I might've forgotten something...
Why shouldn't I buy some new ones?
Ah, I miss those days.
Oh, that's right!
I've never considered that in all my years.
Age gives you a certain perspective on such things.

Experience and patience will help you through any difficult moment. Both things I have plenty of.
Quite right you are.

Oh don't you worry Lettie, our food will come soon.
