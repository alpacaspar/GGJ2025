So that's when I said, it's time tony got a shiny new suit eh?
And then we just measured him up!
You just got to bring her the boquet Tony, the rest of us will wingman it done for ya!
Those fucking "Gangsters" are encroaching on our turf.
We need to show off a little.
I that what happened to Tony?
If we keep coming here I'm going to grow a few sizes.
This place reminds me of my nonna.
Oh shut up!
Garbage disposal called.
Looks like we got a job tonight!
The audacity of those kids to call themselves "Gangsters" we'll show them what real gangsters are like.

Unless you fancy a new suit, you better get back here quick!
You know what's good for ya bud?
Don't end up like Tony!
We work in waste management here bud. You don't want us to be your management.
