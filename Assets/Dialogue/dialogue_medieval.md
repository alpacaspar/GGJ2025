We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent!
Thou disgracest myne honor with thine presence!
For that is how events goeth.
Eruditional!
Effervescent!
Ser Cumference wouldst have loven this place.
Conflagration! Conflagration!
That's whenst I realised myne wench was truly a witch!
Frivulosities disinterest me.
Art thou in serious mind whenst thee speaketh in these terms?
I never hath made it past that damned black knight.
Dark souls are upon us...
Kingdom come shall be delivered too.
The King never did appreciate myne efforts.
Ah... My dearest Priscilla... Myne battle for thee starteth today.
Knighthood is not easily bestowed, you know?
May the Lord grant me strength.
O, may it not tasteth of poultice...
Mayhaps aught we to order from the special menue?
And prehaps myne journey aught finally shepherd me to the King's field.
O, how I pray for thee and thine curse, cousin knight Pavol...
I may have forgotten where I left those old scrolls.

#calling
Cometh!
Come forth!
Wherest be the table wench!
I hath a meal to conquer!
I await thee for duel!
Wench, service me!
I request fair serving!
Idle not so long, a battle awaits only the brave!
Fight me!
Myne preparations art done!
I expect a serving!
I request repart!
Nurishment upon me!
I toss thee a coin, waiter!
Let us joineth in jolly cooperation!

A great ser faces me today! Tell me, what lord serveth thee? Ah, I merely jest! Ahahah! However, naught lollygaggery, with serious heart I bring the request of a mighty repast! Some nurishment that aught bring me sustenance for upcoming battles diminute or colossal! a {00} should do fine in such case. 
Prithee listen to myne pleas. Myne dear Priscilla awaiteth myne arrival at the "Ivory-marble White-gold Tor" and myne beautyful maiden aught be in direst need of succor! Myne query therefore is for thee to bring aught {00} post-haste! I beg thee not tard on thine mission, for thine mission's failings shall naught merely be myne to bear, but shall cost myne Priscilla! 
Ahh hello dear shopkeep, I require thine most fortifying of meals! And dare not to bear news to me that I shant be capable of handling thine grandest repast. I shall enter battle soon and thus request only thine most fortitudinous of nurishments. I beg thee, I demand a puissant {00}. Prithee Thou may bringest me {00} soon with a side of {01}, for I must entre battle soon!

#impatient
Myne quest awaits!
Make haste myne valiant vassal!
The quest never waits for a tardy traveler!
Priscilla needeth me!
Myne strength wanes!
