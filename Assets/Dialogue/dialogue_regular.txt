Hey, waiter! Over here please! Could you come over?
Waiter, waiter!
You lazy sack of shit! I've been waiting here for HOURS it feels like! Hurry up or I'll give your boss a talking!
Uh, can you get my order?
Hey, I'm ready to order.
Hello, waiter?
Man, I can't wait to order!
Ah, there you are! I know what I'd like now.

{orders}
Hello, I would like a {00} with some {01}.
Hey hey, can I get the {00}?
Hey, do you guys have the {10}? It's okay if you don't, I've just really been wanting that dish, but maybe I'll just take a {00} again, at least I know I will enjoy that one, haha!
Oh, hey, it's you again! Long time no see! It's good to have you as my waiter again, always liked how "to the point" you've been... You're always out here just to get our order out of the customer as soon as possible hahaha! You always act like you are in a rush to get the order... Oh, and speaking of ordering, I'm getting a {00} as usual around this time of day. See you soon, chum! Hopefully with a serving platter with my {00}, hah!
Oi! What's your name? I can't really read your badge, are you a misplaced plate boy or something? That thing looks messed up, kid. Anyways listen up and write th√≠s down properly, I want whatever a... "tamburine flussi?" Or does that say "augustine funnily?" Ah damn it boy! Just get me a {00} instead and stop wasting my time with useless banter!
Oh heeey~! I had no idea you worked here! Such a shame to see your pretty face squandered on a place like this! I'll help you out babe~, I want you to bring me a {00}, and I like it "hot~", capiche? Oh, and if you want if you want a good "tip~" be sure to leave your number... I just know you can earn some good money~ with me.
Oh, uh, hi! Uhm, if its okay with you I would like, if you don't mind, a meal... I mean, the, uh, the {00}, if you want.
A {00}, and make it quick!
