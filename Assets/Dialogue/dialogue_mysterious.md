A guy like me, doesn't do all that talkin', I'm a doer not a sayer! That being said... you standing there, expecting me to bring you release... Yes, I've decided. I shall grant it; your peace, my mercy. Don't mention it. I will order from you a {00} and a small {01}. Now you're free to do as you please, go out there and fulfill your destiny, lucky as you are to have one... Not all of us have it easy like that, some of us are just cursed with true freedom, and the world is not kind to those that carve their own path.
