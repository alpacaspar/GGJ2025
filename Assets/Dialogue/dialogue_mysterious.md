*A mysterious figure leans back in their chair in a dark corner of the room.*
*The mysterious figure shifts subtlely in the half-cast shadows*

*A cold stare glances across the room.*
*Chilling eyes pierce through you, as their frigid gaze falls on you.*

#orders
A guy like me, doesn't do all that talkin', I'm a doer not a sayer! That being said... you standing there, expecting me to bring you release from your selfimposed chains... Yes, I've decided. I shall grant it; your peace, my mercy. Don't mention it. I will order from you a {00} and a small {01}. Now you're free to do as you please, go out there and fulfill your destiny, lucky as you are to have one... Not all of us have it easy like that, some of us are just cursed with true freedom, and the world is not kind to those that carve their own path.

*You feel your spine run hot because of the infernal gaze directed at you.*
*Your soul and its sins lay opened bare to the onlooker.*
*The mysterious figure grows weary.*
